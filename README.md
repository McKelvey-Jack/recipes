Hi There,

This is a simple game built with React.

You will need to select a meal from the list. When a meal is selected all other meals will dissapear. 

The player then needs to select an ingredient from the list. When a selection is picked it will appear along with other seletions. When a user is happy that they have all of their ingredients they can click submit ingredients. If they are correct they will see a 'success' message, if they are not the will see a 'try again' message. The user can delete a selection if they wish to. There is functionality to not allow the user to pick more than one of the same item.

The app is styled with flexbox and some basic css.
